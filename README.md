# Orbits
Orbit calculator and solar system orrery

This project is designed to allow users to visualize orbits and trajectories within the Solar System and beyond
Ultimately it may include
    An orbit calculator which enables users to describe orbits using
    any of a variety of methods and then extract dynamical orbit information
    or orbit constants. 
    
    A 3-D visualization of the solar system including planets, asteroids, comets,
    spacecraft, major satellites and rings
    
    A calculator for suggesting trajectories for powered bodies.
    
    Extensions to objects beyond the Solar system using Hipparcos data and known extrasolar planets.

    Extensions to the nearby extragalactic environment.
    
    Handling of relativistic trajectories (especially for the larger scales)
